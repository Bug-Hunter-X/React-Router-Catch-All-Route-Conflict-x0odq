# React Router Catch-All Route Conflict

This repository demonstrates a common issue with React Router's catch-all route (`/*`). When used improperly, it can override more specific routes, causing unexpected rendering behavior. 

The `App.js` file contains the buggy implementation, while `AppSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The catch-all route (`/*`) is designed to handle any unmatched routes. However, if placed incorrectly within the route hierarchy, it can unintentionally intercept requests intended for other, more specific routes.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully positioning the catch-all route. It should always be the last route defined within the `Routes` component to ensure it only matches when no other routes are applicable.
